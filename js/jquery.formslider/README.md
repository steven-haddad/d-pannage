[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/jquery.formslider.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/jquery.formslider/)

This jquery.formslider integrates a modified [Flexslider](https://github.com/formslider/FlexSlider) with logical slide pages that can have features and behaviors provided by plugins.

The main goal is to have different actions and policies triggered depending on what role the actual slide is. For example: You can stop going forward when a formula input is invalid.

The jquery.formslider runs in production, is performance optimized, full responsive and touch capable. You can easily write you own plugins and implement custom slide behaviors.

Check out the demo implementation: [formslider.github.io](https://formslider.github.io/).

## Installation
```bash
bower install jquery.formslider --save

# or

npm install -g bower
npm install jquery.formslider --save

# if you want to develop the source you also have to:

npm install gulp-cli -g

```

## Integration
Check out this guide: [INTEGRATION](docs/INTEGRATION.md).

Source code for a minmal setup without any styling: https://github.com/formslider/jquery.formslider.demo.

### Example use case
This is a typical use case for marketer customers journey:
  * you have a few **question slides** the user can answer and go forth and back
  * there is a **zipcode slide** the user can enter a 4-5 digit zipcode
  * the **loader slide** shows a loading animation while navigation is blocked
  * the **contact slide** collects contact information and submits them together with the answers
  * the **confirmation slide** shows error/success message and gives more deeplinks

This functionality is provided by core or optional plugins. You can also develop your own logical flow by extend, interact  or configure these plugins.
